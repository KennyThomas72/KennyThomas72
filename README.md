### Basic Project Info

The company 'Best Refrigeration (BR)' and subsequent locations and data is fictitious.

An internship I held through my junior and senior years of college was at 'United States Cold Storage (USCS)'. During my time there I was involved in Renewable Energy initiative projects that involved significant data gathering. Data pulled from my internship serves as the basis for these projects. In order to keep confidentiality, all data, site locations, company references have been changed/randomized/hidden so there is no reference/resemblance to actual USCS company information.

The process of changing the data will not be referenced elsewhere in the project and Best Refrigeration (BR) will be treated as an actual entity - and thus the client for the scope of this project.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and look through my portfolio - I appreciate your time! :)
